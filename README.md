Xript, an OS development language designed for runtime speed, and to be high level and low level at the same time.
Xript has a fully cross platform, custom graphics API designed for high performance (WIP). Xript is designed for HPC, OS development and backend development. It compiles practically everywhere, because the XriptÂ´s compiler (not built yet) has a plug and play feature, 
where there is a JSON put in place and all commands are read from it. Xript can also be Just-In-Time (JIT) compiled with a virtual machine (not built yet).
